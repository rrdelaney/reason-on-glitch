# [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) on Glitch!

Hello! This is an example of using ReasonML on Glitch!

You can find an example of an Express server written in ReasonML in the `src`
directory. It serves text on the `/` path and JSON on the `/status` path! To
make edits to this yourself checkout the "Remix this" button! To view the live 
example click the "Show" button on top!

This app also renders views using ReasonReact for the client side and server
side -- this is a full SSR example of ReasonReact!
